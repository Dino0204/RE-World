## Coding Rules

- When managing states, unless they are strictly limited to two states (true/false), we avoid managing them as boolean states to ensure code extensibility.

- Do not use abbreviations when writing variable names.

- When writing functions, use pure functions whenever possible.

- Do not add comments except for essential ones.

- Do not use Berrel Export
